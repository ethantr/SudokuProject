# SudokuProject
My first small passion project, experimenting with basic Java.


# Sudoku (Text Version)
A text version of suduko, where users will input a number, with the row and column they would like to place the number in.
# Sudoku (GUI Version)
Using the text version as a basis, this variant is made using Java Swing to create the GUI elements.
